# Wehe Command Line Client

This is the Wehe command line client. This app runs tests to help users determine whether their ISPs
are throttling network traffic for certain apps or ports. Please see https://wehe.meddle.mobi/ for
more details.

There are two ways to run the code:

1) Run the jar file (`wehe-cmdline.jar`)
2) Build from source (use Java 11)

## About the Code

* The code is based off of the Wehe [Android Client](https://github.com/NEU-SNS/wehe-android). 
* Building the source code requires two additional libraries: 
  [Tyrus Standalone Client v1.17](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish.tyrus.bundles/tyrus-standalone-client/1.17)
  for WebSocket support and [JSON](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)
  ([Maven repo](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json/20201115)).
* The `src/` directory contains the source files.
* The `res/` directory contains the app and port client traffic for the tests.
* The code runs one test (one app/port replay and one "random" replay) for each shell command.

## Run the jar

A compiled jar comes with the repo (`wehe-cmdline.jar`). This jar was compiled using Java 11.

### Usage

Usage: `java -jar wehe-cmdline.jar -n <TEST_NAME> [OPTION]...`

Example: `java -jar wehe-cmdline.jar -n applemusic -c -r results/ -l info`

**Options**

`-n TEST_NAME` - The name of the test to run. **Argument required. See below for list of test names.**

`-s SERV_NAME` - The hostname or IP of server to run the tests. Default: `wehe4.meddle.mobi`.

`-m MLAB_API` - The URL of the API to retrieve access envelopes to run tests on M-Lab servers. 
Default: `https://locate.measurementlab.net/v2/nearest/wehe/replay`.

`-u MUM_SRVR` - The number of servers to run the test concurrently. This feature is available only 
with M-Lab servers. Must be integer between 1 and 4 inclusive. Default: `1`.

`-c` - Turn off confirmation replays (if test is inconclusive, it will automatically rerun by default).

`-a A_THRESH` - The area threshold percentage for determining differentiation. Default: `50`.

`-k KS2P_VAL` - The KS2P-value threshold percentage for determining differentiation. Default: `1`.

`-t RESR_ROOT` - The resources root containing `apps_list.json` and the tests. No need to change 
this if using the jar or if you don't move the `res/` directory. Default: `res/`.

`-r RSLT_ROOT` - The results root containing the output logs and info. Default: `test_results/`.

`-l LOG_LEVEL` - The level of logs and above that should be printed to console (all levels will be 
saved to logs on disk regardless of the level printed to console). Choose from `wtf`, `error`, 
`warn`, `info`, or `debug`. Default: none of these, only `UI` logs (what the user would see on screen
when running the Android app) will be printed to the console.

`-h` - Print the help message.

`-v` - Print the version number.

### Output

Output is contained in `RSLT_ROOT`:

* By default, the name of `RSLT_ROOT` is `res/` (change the directory name using the `-r` option).
* `info.txt` - This file contains the user's random ID and the current history count.
* `logs/` - This directory contains the logs that would be printed to the Android logs (think of 
  Android's Log class).
  * Log files are the in the format `logs_<randomID>_<historyCount>_<exitCode>.txt`.
* `ui/` - This directory contains the text that a user running the Android client would see on 
  his/her screen.
  * Log files are in the format `ui_<randomID>_<historyCount>_<exitCode>.txt`.

**Exit Codes**

Each error exit code corresponds to a specific spot in the code where execution of the tests was
terminated. CTRL+F the exit status on the code base to find where each of these locations are
located.

`ERR_WR_LOGS`. For example, `-24` means no result was found and the logs could not be written to disk.
